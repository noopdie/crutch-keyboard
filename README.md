# Qt client side window decorations demo

Project to test the API for cross-platform client side window decorations in Qt which was introduced in Qt 5.15 ([QTBUG-73011](https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-73011)).

See the [blog post](https://www.qt.io/blog/custom-window-decorations) I wrote for details.

It should work on X11, Wayland, Windows and macOS (macOS has no resize support though).

There are two demo applications in this project.

The `filebrowser` demo should look something like this:

The other demo `webbrowser.qml` is just a single file, and can just be run with

```sh
$ qml webbrowser.qml
```

It should look like this:
